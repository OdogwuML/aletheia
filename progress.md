### Protocol 0: Initialization
- **Action:** Completed 5 Discovery Questions with user.
- **Answers:** North Star confirmed, integrations chosen (Paystack, Resend, Termii), database = Supabase, backend = Golang, hosting = Vercel, currency = Naira only.
- **Research:** Verified Go SDKs exist for all 4 integrations. Noted Paystack uses kobo, Supabase Go SDK has limited docs for complex queries, and Vercel Go backend may need serverless approach.
- **Action:** Created all project memory files (`gemini.md`, `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`) populated with real project data.
- **Action:** Defined JSON data schema (Users, Buildings, Units, Payments, Notifications) in `gemini.md`.
- **Result:** ✅ Protocol 0 complete. Awaiting user confirmation of data schema.
- **Errors:** None
- **Next:** User reviews data schema → create implementation plan → begin Phase 1 Blueprint.
